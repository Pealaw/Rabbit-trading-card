        The American rabbit is very familiar and noted for a good ‘sweet’
        temperament and also for good mothering abilities. It is a hardy breed
        and typically docile in nature. They produce large litters and are
        usually very good mothers. The fryers grow faster and reach marketable
        weight very quickly. They are very friendly and it’s very easy to care
        for them
